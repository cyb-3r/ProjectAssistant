# Project Assistant

## Description

CLPA is a minimalist CLI Project Assistant that help you managing a project only using commands. It's a tool I made for myself to make my projects' file structure consistent and to generate project componements easily and fast. Yes, IDEs exist, but I like using text editors more so that's why this exists.

This project is also an excuse to make a full program and test my programming knowledge.

While this is a tool I've programmed and built for my personnal usage, I'm leaving it here for some curious people just in case.
